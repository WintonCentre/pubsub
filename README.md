# A Publish/Subscribe library

###Installation

This library is under development and must be installed from a local copy rather than clojars.

Clone the repository to a `pubsub` directory, then:
```
cd pubsub
lein install
```

#### Current version
[ pubsub "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT" ]

## API





## Run devcard tests

The project.clj is configured to run inside an Intellij REPL. [See details here](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Running-figwheel-in-a-Cursive-Clojure-REPL): 

If you prefer to run tests using `lein figwheel devcards` from the command line, follow the comments in project.clj to remove figwheel-sidecar references.
